# How to subtheme Olivero.
Technically Olivero does not support subtheming, in this document I'll walk you through copying a Olivero into a new theme and making changes to the CSS and JavaScript.

## Why no subtheming of Olivero?
Olivero isn't quite stable in Drupal 9. We're still making lots of changes to the markup, which can screw up any CSS overrides that you have in place. Even after reaching stabe, we likely won't support subtheming immediately because of various non-critical technical debt issues that we want to fix.

## Steps to copy Olivero into a new theme.
Instead of subtheming, we're going to copy the core theme into a new theme.

1. Copy the `/core/themes/olivero` directory into the `/themes/` directory.
2. Rename the files in the new theme.
   1. Change the directory name from `olivero` to the new theme name (in these example, we'll use `coco`). So rename the `olivero` directory to `coco` (Coco is my dogs name).
   2. Rename the `olivero.info.yml` file to `coco.info.yml`
   3. Rename `olivero.breakpoints.yml` file to `coco.breakpoints.yml`
   4. Rename `olivero.libraries.yml` file to `coco.libraries.yml`
   5. Rename `olivero.theme` file to `coco.theme`
   6. Rename all of the `olivero` config within the theme's `config` directory to `coco`. For example, rename `block.block.olivero_account_menu.yml` to `block.block.coco_account_menu.yml`. There are a number of files in there to rename.
   7. Rename `/src/OliveroPreRender.php` to `/src/CocoPreRender.php`.
3. Do a global search and replace for the name. When you search and replace, be case-sensitive
   1. Search and replace `Olivero` with `Coco`.
   2. Search and replace `olivero` with `coco`.

## Enable the new theme.
You should now see the new `Coco` theme listed under `appearance > themes`. Enable it. It should look exactly like the default core Olivero theme.

## Copy the CSS and JavaScript compilation scripts.
Copy the following from this repository into the new theme. These scripts will enable you to make change in the source files and have them compile down to regular CSS and JS.

* `package.json` file
* `package.lock` file
* `scripts/` directory

## Install Node dependencies.
First make sure you have Node, and Yarn installed. Then run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.

## Make a change to the CSS styles.
Within the theme you'll notice both regular `*.css` files and also `*.pcss.css` files. The files that you want to modify are the `*.pcss.css` files. These PostCSS files will be compiled into IE11 compatible CSS by running the compilation scripts.


1. Open up the `/css/base/variables.pcss.css`.
2. Change some of the blue color's hex values down near line 132.
3. To generate the CSS run `yarn build:css`.

Note you can also watch CSS by running `yarn watch:css`.

See the scripts section within the `package.json` file for more commands.

## Make a change to the JavaScript.
Similar to CSS, there are two JavaScript files for each file:

* `*.es6.js` - These are the files that you will modify. They are written using modern JavaScript.
* `*.js` - These are the IE11 compatile JavaScript files generated by runnning the compiliation scripts. Do not directly modifiy these files.

You compile changes to the JavaScript files by running `yarn watch:js` and `yarn build:js`.
